					<h1>Legacy ZAMNHLMP Versions</h1>
					<div class="main-content">
						<p>There's also something else I wanted to announce. Today, on 5th June 2021, all previous versions of ZAMNHLMP (Half-Life: Zombies Ate My Neighbours Multiplayer and Shooter Tourneys), including versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, will be removed from Mod DB. This is to avoid confusion, and so that players don't have conflicting versions as we have replaced, moved and removed files - the playtesters had these issues and had to delete their game every time they updated.</p>
						<p>All previous versions will still be archived and hosted at:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/phoenixprojectsoftware/zamnhlmp/releases">https://github.com/phoenixprojectsoftware/zamnhlmp/releases</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>We look forward to releasing 2.5, and we hope you enjoy it. Meanwhile, have fun, and keep fragging!</p>
